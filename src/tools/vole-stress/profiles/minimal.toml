# Minimal profile — small but valid codebase for quick sanity checks.
#
# Target characteristics:
# - 1 module + main.vole
# - 2-3 simple functions
# - Basic types only (i64, string, bool)
# - No generics, no interfaces
# - Simple expressions (arithmetic, comparisons, calls)
# - Target: <100 lines total, compiles in <100ms
