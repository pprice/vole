# Wide-types profile — stress type system with breadth.
#
# Generates code with extreme type widths to test:
# - Functions with many parameters (20-50 params)
# - Generics with many type parameters (5-10 type params)
# - Types with many fields (20-50 fields)
# - Interfaces with many methods
#
# Target: stress signature processing, type checking width,
# memory for type representations.
