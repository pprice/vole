// Regression test for Symbol mismatch bug
// Previously, Symbol IDs from different interners could collide.
// e.g., "UnknownTrait" might get Symbol(1) in user code, but Symbol(1)
// from prelude was "Equatable", causing false matches.

// This should correctly error - "FakePreludeTrait" doesn't exist
